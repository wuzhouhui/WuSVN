Main patches:
      1. Output paging automatically
      2. Ignore files if they match the patterns in .svnignore
      3. Syntax highlight
      4. New subcommand clean for removing unversioned files
      5. Add option -v for subcommand commit, for print unified diff in log
         message template
      6. Add option --stat for subcommand diff and log
      7. Support client side pre-commit hook, hook scripts locate in
         .svn/hooks
