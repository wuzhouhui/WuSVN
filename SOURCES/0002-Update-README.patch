-I.    A FEW POINTERS
-
-      For an overview of the Subversion project, visit
-
-         http://subversion.apache.org/
-
-      Once you have a Subversion client you can get the latest version
-      of the code with the command:
-
-         $ svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk subversion
-
-
-
-II.   DOCUMENTATION
-
-      The main documentation is the Subversion Book - an on-line version
-      can be found at:
-      
-         http://svnbook.red-bean.com/
-
-      It is written in DocBook XML, and the sources can be found at:
-
-         http://svn.code.sf.net/p/svnbook/source/trunk/
-         
-      If you wish to build the documentation from source, read the
-      en/README file within the book source.
-
-
-
-III.  PARTICIPATING IN THE SUBVERSION COMMUNITY
-
-      First, read http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/
-      It describes Subversion coding and log message standards, as well
-      as how to join discussion lists.
-
-      Talk on IRC with developers:  irc.freenode.net, channel #svn-dev.
-
-      Read the FAQ:  http://subversion.apache.org/faq.html
-
-
-
-IV.   QUICKSTART GUIDE
-
-      See the final section of the first chapter of the Subversion Book.
-
-
-
-V.    CONVERTING FROM CVS
-
-      If you're a CVS user trying to move your CVS history over to
-      Subversion, then be sure to visit the 'cvs2svn' project:
-
-         http://cvs2svn.tigris.org
-
-      You can get the latest released version of the cvs2svn converter
-      from the project downloads area:
-
-         http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=2976
-
-      Please note that the cvs2svn project is a *separate* project from
-      Subversion.  If you have problems with cvs2svn or are confused,
-      please email the cvs2svn project's mailing lists, not the
-      Subversion lists.
-
-      Finally, be sure to see Appendix B in the Subversion Book.  It
-      contains a very quick overview of the major differences between
-      CVS and Subversion.
